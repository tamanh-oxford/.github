In January 2025, the [Tam Anh Research Institute](https://tamri.vn/en/) signed an MoU with the [International Health and Tropical Medicine Group](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/study-with-us/msc-ihtm), [Centre for Global Health Research](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/research/ndm-cghr), [Nuffield Department of Medicine](https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/), launching the start of an innovative partnership between one of Vietnam’s leading private healthcare and vaccine establishments and Oxford University. This is an exciting time for such a partnership given Vietnam’s rapid economic growth, epidemiological transition, and national prioritisation for healthcare innovations. This also aligns with the University’s agenda to cultivate strategic and equitable international partnerships to tackle global challenges.

**TOP** aims to foster a sustainable, demand-driven partnership that sets a framework for collaboration, maximising local impact and generating global health insights with a focus on non-communicable diseases and innovations in preventive healthcare. Capacity sharing through expert exchanges and reciprocal training is at the heart of this alliance.

**TOP** flips the traditional global health dynamic. Priorities are set by Vietnamese leadership to ensure that research is rooted in the needs of Vietnam’s healthcare system with funding provided by Vietnam’s growing private sector and evidence translated to national policies. This creates a powerful synergy with Oxford bringing global expertise, rigor, and integrity and Tam Anh bringing agility, innovation, and alignment with government to facilitate national policy adoption.
